# React Native digital art smart canvas app

This app is a 'smart canvas' app, designed to allow users to view works of digital art that they own.

I made it for my company Gallery, and I am posting it here as an example of a front end project I made.

Here are the steps to run the app from a terminal:

```
Clone the repository
Enter the repository with cd GalleryMobileFrontend
Run 'NPM Install' to install everything
Make sure that you have Xcode installed so you can run the simulator
Then, run the program with 'react-native run-ios' to see the app on an iPhone 6
To run it on an iPad, run it with 'react-native run-ios --simulator="iPad Pro" ''
```

Here are some screenshots of the app:
